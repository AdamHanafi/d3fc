# D3 Financial Components [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ScottLogic/d3-financial-components.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ScottLogic/d3-financial-components)

We are building a set of re-usable [D3](http://d3js.org) components that make it simple to create complex financial charts.

The project is currently under development and very much in a state of flux!

## Examples

The [Scott Logic blog](http://www.scottlogic.com/blog/) provides several posts that show some of the earlier iterations of these components:
