#D3 Financial Components

We are building a set of re-useable [D3](http://d3js.org) components that make it easier to create financial charts. Some of these components have been demonstrated via the following blogs:

 + [An interactive crosshair component](http://www.scottlogic.com/blog/2014/09/29/crosshairs.html)
 + [A re-based comparison chart](http://www.scottlogic.com/blog/2014/09/26/an-interactive-stock-comparison-chart-with-d3.html)
 + [A bollinger band component](http://www.scottlogic.com/blog/2014/08/28/bollinger.html)
 + [Line annotations](http://www.scottlogic.com/blog/2014/08/26/two-line-components-for-d3-charts.html)
 + [OHLC and candlestick charts](http://www.scottlogic.com/blog/2014/08/19/an-ohlc-chart-component-for-d3.html)
 
We are in the process of tidying up these components into a single 'package'.
